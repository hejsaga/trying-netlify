Goal: 

ðŸ‘‰ You should be able to log in and out of the application. 
ðŸ‘‰ When reloading the page, the isLoggedIn-state should remain the same as it did before reloading.
ðŸ‘‰ You should be able to manually change the name while logged into the app.
ðŸ‘‰ This should be done via a form and when submitting, the name should be changed instantly.
ðŸ‘‰ Create a custom hook that handles changes and state of an input. 



1. To solve issue with state remaining the same, we use localStorage. 
Add two functions to userContext, one for logging in and one for logging out. Do not forget to provide them to the app!
2. All logic for logging in/out can be at the same place, the navigation bar. Use the new context functions and conditionally render name/login/logout
3. To be able to change the name via input, we need to create a form
4. Create a custom hook to handle changes and state of an input. Remember how a hook should be named
5. Use the hook to track changes, and on submit, update username in context












Show callBack example <Form callBack={(name, email) => handleUsernameUpdate(name, email)} />
